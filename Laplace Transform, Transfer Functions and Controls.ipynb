    "So, one limitation of our current controllers is that they only measure information from one source and output to one source, but what about if we wanted to measure from measure from multiple sources and output to multiple motors? An example of where you want to do this is with a quadcopter. You have multiple things you are sensing (roll, pitch, yaw, elevation, etc) and the motors. In fact, motor quadcopters with have ~60 things that they are sensing and want to predict based on their model of the system what the based thing they should do with the motors is.\n",

    "So, there are a few things that we can talk about with regard to model predictive control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is what kind of systems are controllable?\n",
    "For a state in a system to be controllable means that the controller on the system is able to make that state track the value we want it to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sludds defined controllable\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is what kind of states are observable?\n",
    "Observability is a really interesting thing in our system. With a very good model of our system we can say that there are things that we want to sense that are related to other things that we are sensing in our system. For example, in rocket design we want to be able to sense the stress on the fusalage of the rocket. However, putting strain-gauages all along the side of the rocket is a horrible idea (they get heavy, change aerodynamics, burn up as you travel through the atmosphere etc). So, what NASA/SpaceX/yuppie rocket startup will do is have a ton of sensors inside of their rocket which from simulation they are able to return a huge matrix representing the model of the system. They hope that, the states that they care about (strain/stress on fusalage in this example, in reality they might have 1000 or so states that they want to make sure that they can observe reasonably well).\n",
    "Mathematically observability is defined as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sludds defined observability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can talk about the Kalman Filter. \n",
    "With our state space model of the system we assume that the model has a certain amount of fixed weight and that the incoming data has a certain amount of fixed weight. However, with the Kalman Filter we are assuming that that weight updates as a function of how sure we are that the incoming data is reliable. Essentially, if the sensors start freaking out from how we think they should perform we are going to move towards our model to minimize the effect of defective sensors on the controller. If our model starts freaking out (maybe because it is a poor model) we will rely on the sensors more. This turns out to be the provably most optimal filter for systems with Gaussian noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the takeaway from today's lecture:\n",
    "If you don't have a model of your system and it is reasonably simple, throw a PID controller on it and play with the parameters until it works.\n",
    "If you do have a model of your system, first prove that it is a controlable system using the definition of controlability that we talked about above. Then, throw a Kalman filter on top of it. This is honestly has a very large amount of industrial controls are done and with this knowledge you should be able to control just about anything that you want to."
